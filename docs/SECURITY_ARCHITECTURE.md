# Security Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture implemented in our application, including authentication, authorization, data access controls, and security best practices.

## Security Layers

### Authentication Layer
- **Session Management**: Robust session handling with proper cleanup and refresh mechanisms
- **Token Validation**: Multi-factor token validation with expiration checking
- **Protected Routes**: Enhanced route protection with admin-specific controls
- **Authentication State**: Consistent authentication state management across the application

### Authorization Layer
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Centralized role verification with multiple fallback strategies
- **Permission Validation**: Granular permission checking for all operations
- **Admin Controls**: Special admin-only functions with proper verification
- **User Ownership**: Validation that users can only access their own data

### Data Security Layer
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level protection enforced through policies
- **Security Definer Functions**: Preventing recursion and enforcing security at the database level
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the application to prevent data injection

### PDF Security Layer
- **Access Validation**: Permission checking before accessing any PDF
- **Signed URLs**: Short-lived signed URLs for secure access
- **Audit Logging**: Tracking all PDF access for security monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't reveal sensitive information

## Security Components

### Core Security Services
- `authVerification.ts`: Role and permission verification
- `userAccess.ts`: Secure user data retrieval
- `sessionManagement.ts`: Session handling and cleanup
- `userFetch.ts`: Secure user data fetching with validation

### Security Hooks
- `useSecureJobValidation`: Enhanced job access validation
- `useSecureSessionValidation`: Comprehensive session validation
- `useUserManagement`: Secure user management operations

### Secure UI Components
- `SecureProtectedRoute`: Enhanced route protection with session validation
- `UserTableContainer`: Secure user management interface

## Security Design Principles

### Defense in Depth
The system implements multiple layers of security, ensuring that if one fails, others are still in place to protect resources.

### Least Privilege
Users only have access to the minimum resources and operations needed to perform their tasks.

### Fail Secure
When errors occur or validation fails, the system defaults to denying access rather than allowing it.

### Complete Mediation
Every access to every resource is checked for proper authorization.

### Security by Design
Security is built into the core architecture rather than added as an afterthought.

## Error Handling

### Security-Related Errors
- All security-related errors are logged for monitoring
- User-facing error messages are sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed error information is only available in secure logs

### Session Errors
- Sessions are properly validated with attempt to refresh
- Users are prompted to re-authenticate when sessions cannot be verified
- Token expiration is handled gracefully with proper user notification

## Security Testing
- Regular security testing should be performed
- Both automated scanning and manual testing are recommended
- Special attention should be given to authentication and authorization flows

## Security Maintenance
- Keep all dependencies updated regularly
- Monitor for security issues in dependencies
- Review security architecture periodically for improvements
- Maintain awareness of new security threats and mitigations
