Sample Payloads

Append Only (default behavior)
Schedules only stages without existing slots:

{
  "commit": true,
  "onlyIfUnset": true,
  "onlyJobIds": ["c34f9d0d-...","1e2ab3f1-..."],
  "baseStart": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
Full Reflow (ignore existing slots and reschedule)

{
  "commit": true,
  "onlyIfUnset": false
}
Simulated Run (proposed/commit flags)
Dry run that does not insert slots:

{
  "commit": false,
  "proposed": true,
  "onlyIfUnset": true
}
These examples can be adjusted with onlyJobIds, baseStart, or nuclear as needed.
