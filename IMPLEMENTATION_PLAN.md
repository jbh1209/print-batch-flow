## **Phase 4: Real-time Tracking & Analytics** âœ… **COMPLETE**

### Objectives
- âœ… Capture actual start/end times and compare to scheduled times
- âœ… Save timing variances to inform future scheduling adjustments
- âœ… Add real-time queue updates when operators start/complete jobs
- âœ… Create performance analytics dashboard for supervisors to identify timing patterns

**Implemented Components:**
- `useTimingVarianceTracking` hook for analyzing scheduled vs actual timing performance
- `useRealTimeQueueUpdates` hook for live queue monitoring and metrics
- `SupervisorPerformanceDashboard` with timing variance analysis, scheduling accuracy metrics, and real-time activity feed
- Enhanced `TrackerAnalytics` page with tabbed interface for workflow and performance analytics
- Real-time Supabase subscriptions for live updates on job stage changes
